# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Curriculum

Welcome to the comprehensive Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics learning path. This curriculum is structured into five progressive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of modern robotics systems.

## About This Course

This course covers the cutting-edge intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on creating intelligent, embodied systems. You'll learn to build robots that can perceive, reason, and act in complex real-world environments.

## Module Structure

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System](./module-01-ros2/architecture)
Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2, the Robot Operating System, which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications. Understand nodes, topics, services, and how to create Python agents that interact with the robotic system.

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin](./module-02-digital-twin/gazebo-setup)
Explore simulation environments that serve as digital twins for robotic systems. Learn to use Gazebo and Unity for creating realistic simulation environments for testing and training.

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain](./module-03-robot-brain/isaac-sim)
Dive into advanced AI systems for robotics, including Isaac Sim for AI training and Nav2 for autonomous navigation. Understand how to create intelligent control systems.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./module-04-vla/voice-control)
Master the integration of perception, language understanding, and action execution. Learn to use Whisper for voice commands and LLMs for high-level robotic control.

### [Module 5: Capstone Project](./module-05-capstone/final-project)
Apply all concepts learned in a comprehensive capstone project that integrates all modules into a complete intelligent robotic system.

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System](./module-01-ros2/architecture) to start your journey in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Each module contains theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Learning Approach
