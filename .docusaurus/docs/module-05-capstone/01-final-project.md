# Capstone Project Brief

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the robotics curriculum into a comprehensive final project.

## Project Overview

The capstone project challenges students to design and implement an intelligent robotic system that combines:

- ROS 2 communication and node architecture
- Digital twin simulation environments
- AI-powered navigation and control
- Vision-language-action capabilities
- Real-world deployment considerations

## Project Requirements

Students must develop a system that demonstrates:

1. **Multi-modal interaction**: Voice commands and natural language processing
2. **Autonomous navigation**: Using Nav2 for complex environment navigation
3. **Simulation integration**: Testing in digital twin environments
4. **AI control**: LLM-based high-level decision making
5. **Real-world application**: Practical use case implementation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: System Design
- Architecture planning
- Component integration design
- Safety and reliability considerations

### Phase 2: Development
- Individual component implementation
- Integration and testing
- Iterative refinement

### Phase 3: Integration & Deployment
- Full system integration
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and presentation

## Evaluation Criteria

Projects will be evaluated based on:

- Technical complexity and implementation quality
- Integration of multiple modules learned
- Innovation and creative problem solving
- Performance in simulation and/or real-world testing
- Documentation and presentation quality

## Resources

Students have access to:
- All previous module materials
- Technical support and mentorship
- Simulation environments and hardware (where applicable)
- Best practices documentation
